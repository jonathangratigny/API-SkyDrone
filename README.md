# API for SkyDrone Project

SkyDrone project is an e-commerce digitalization solution entirely build with MERN stack : MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS.
As students, this year projects was a way to conceptualize, discover, develop and deploy the API to be able to feed all of the solution.

API is feeding 3 layers : 
  - website (ReactJS), 
  - mobile (React Native) 
  - desktop (ElectronJS).

API is hosted at this endpoint https://wwww.skydrone-api.herokuapp.com/api-doc/ to be accessible for all layers.

I handle many technologies, surely not as deep as I wish but is it realistics in this so short laps time ? 

Anyway, we took a lot of fun to build it and for sure, this isn't the last one!
